CyberMiles Community Update (mid-July 2019)
Vitalik speaks (re: CM), our app stakes (CMT), a “smart contract first” take, and more

1. Ethereum co-founder on transaction fees (including CyberMiles’)

On Twitter, Balaji S. Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase, recently referenced the “network defect” (i.e. when increasing the size beyond a certain point decreases the value of a network). Replying to this “anti-network effect,” Vitalik Buterin noted the “congestion and non-scalability of certain traits of communities,” sharing a prime example: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1145165787998482432

In response, Dr. Michael Yuan, CyberMiles’ co-founder, elaborated:
As a decentralized e-commerce platform, designed alt gas mechanisms for the EVM to improve UX (metered free TX, dev pays gas, etc.). A nice side effect is that CM could be an agile “test ground” for new language and VM features for the Ethereum community.

5. ICYMI: Smart contracts on Libra

Since last month’s announcement, much has been made of Facebook’s Libra project. Among the more talked-about questions:
Will I be able to deploy Smart Contracts on the Libra blockchain? https://insidelibra.org/t/will-i-be-able-to-deploy-smart-contracts-on-the-libra-blockchain/13/2

In the announcement about Libra coin I saw that with the newly introduced Move language, developers will be able to…
insidelibra.org

Yes, you’ll be able to design and deploy smart contracts on Libra. As a matter of fact, smart contracts are a big thing on the Libra blockchain, according to insidelibra.org.

CyberMiles’ Dr. Michael Yuan pointed out the fundamental differences of “traditional” blockchains that support smart contracts (Bitcoin, Ethereum) and Libra:

One of the most striking design features of Libra is its ‘smart contract first’ approach. One could argue that even on a smart contract platform like Ethereum, smart contract executions are just one type of transactions. Ethereum’s ‘native’ operations are still coin transactions. Libra is different. Smart contracts are first class citizens on Libra.

This is a potential game changer. Making “money smart” by design will enable many, many different use cases emerging.
