3. The future of retail: CyberMiles' co-founder weighs in

Most shoppers are aware of the convenience of e-commerce, as well as flaws with shopper-derived data security. But a closer look reveals far more about the future of retail than the average consumer knows. So what is the future of retail? 

According to Dr. Lucas Lu, one of CyberMiles' co-founder:

"Today's high-tech, urbanized environment favors big-box retailers like Walmart and e-commerce giants like Amazon. Centralized operations, though efficient, tend to focus on selling new, standardized products, leading to less durability and more waste. However, we're starting to see a return to decentralized, localized commerce."
